# Project and Repository Structures.

# Branching strategies.
A branch is always made from an existing branch. Normally, you could build a new branch off of the repository's default branch. Then, you may work on this new branch independently from other people's repository modifications. When you're finished, you may submit a pull request to another branch in order to merge the modifications made in the head branch into that branch (the base branch). After a pull request has been merged, or closed, you can delete the head branch as this is no longer needed.

# Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
All the information that needs to be secured will be store in a secrets file created using a secrets repository we are interested in, select the Settings menu at the top, then the Secrets submenu, here we choose whether we are focused on Actions or Dependabot level, and then click the “New repository secret” button.
